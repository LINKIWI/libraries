TYPES

// tailer sequence to every outgoing message.

// Noop is a Transport interface-compliant implementation that noops on all operations.
// It is intended to be used as a placeholder implementation when no real transport is available.

// reestablish connections to the underlying transport at regular intervals if the transmission
// error count exceeds a defined threshold.

FUNCTIONS

// Close flushes all remaining queued payloads and closes the backing transport.
func (t *Buffered) Close() error

// Send asynchronously queues the payload for transmission. If the queue size has reached the batch
// size, all queued payloads are flushed.
func (t *Buffered) Send(data []byte) (int, error)

// Close attempts to close all underlying transports, accumulating errors for individual failed
// closures.
func (t *Composite) Close() error

// Send concurrently dispatches the data payload to all transport backends and blocks until the
// desired write consistency level is satisfied. Note that, due to the concurrent nature of the
// composite write, the number of sent bytes should be considered meaningless regardless of the
// desired write consistency level.
func (t *Composite) Send(data []byte) (int, error)

// Close closes the underlying file&#39;s file descriptor.
func (t *File) Close() error

// Send writes a chunk of data to the end of the file.
func (t *File) Send(data []byte) (int, error)

// Send appends the constant binary tailer sequence to the message and dispatches the write request
// to the underlying transport. Note that this assumes that every Send invocation corresponds to a
// fully formed &#34;message&#34; in the protocol leveraging this transport.
func (t *Framed) Send(message []byte) (int, error)

// Close defers to the underlying transport implementation, if initialized, to close the transport.
func (t *Lazy) Close() error

// Send idempotently initializes the underlying transport, followed by using the transport to send
// the requested data.
func (t *Lazy) Send(data []byte) (int, error)

// Close noops.
func (t *Noop) Close() error

// Send noops.
func (t *Noop) Send(data []byte) (int, error)

// Close defers to the underlying transport to close the transport. It also requests a graceful stop
// to the internal ticker for evaluating the current transport error count.
func (t *Reconnecting) Close() error

// Send defers to the underlying transport to transmit the data. Internally, the number of send
// errors from the backing transport is atomically tracked for evaluation in an asynchronous check
// path. Note that failed writes are silently ignored (considered lost) and not buffered for retry.
func (t *Reconnecting) Send(data []byte) (int, error)

// Close closes the underlying TCP socket.
func (t *TCP) Close() error

// Send initiates a reliable transmission of an arbitrary payload, respecting timeout parameters.
func (t *TCP) Send(data []byte) (int, error)

// NewBuffered creates a new buffered transport over an existing Transport backend.
func NewBuffered(backendFactory Factory, size int) (Transport, error)

// NewComposite create a new composite transport over multiple existing Transport backends.
func NewComposite(backendFactories []Factory, consistency writeConsistencyLevel) (Transport, error)

// NewDirectTCP establishes a TCP transport client against the target address directly.
func NewDirectTCP(addr string, cfg TCPSocketConfig) (Transport, error)

// NewFile creates a File transport for a target file path on disk.
// The file is opened in append mode, and will be created if it does not already exist.
func NewFile(path string) (Transport, error)

// NewFramed creates a new framed transport over an existing Transport backend.
func NewFramed(backendFactory Factory, tailer []byte) (Transport, error)

// NewLazy creates a Transport that lazily initializes the underlying network transport client.
func NewLazy(backendFactory Factory) (Transport, error)

// NewNoop creates a new Noop transport.
func NewNoop() Transport

// NewProxiedTCP establishes a TCP transport client against the target address via an intermediate
// SOCKS5 proxy server.
func NewProxiedTCP(addr string, proxyNet string, proxyAddr string, cfg TCPSocketConfig) (Transport, error)

// NewReconnecting creates an automatically reconnecting transport over an existing transport
// backend. Note that it is expected that the callee supply a transport factory that may be invoked
// lazily, since the client will reestablish connections by simply closing the existing transport
// and creating a new one.
func NewReconnecting(backendFactory Factory, duration time.Duration, threshold int64) (Transport, error)

// NewUDP creates a UDP transport for a target address.
func NewUDP(addr string) (Transport, error)

// NewUDS creates a Unix datagram socket transport for a a Unix socket at the target disk path.
func NewUDS(path string) (Transport, error)

// Close closes the underlying UDP socket.
func (t *UDP) Close() error

// Send initiates a fire-and-forget transmission of an arbitrary payload.
func (t *UDP) Send(data []byte) (int, error)

// Close closes the underlying UDP socket.
